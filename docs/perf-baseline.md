# Performance Baseline

This file records the baseline evidence required by
`docs/goals-and-guardrails.md`. Measurements must exclude browser, test runner,
Ollama, llama.cpp, CUDA, TTS, ASR, and other worker/model processes from the Go
core number.

## Environment

- Date: 2026-06-30
- OS and architecture: Windows / amd64
- Go toolchain: Go 1.26.3

## Measurements

| App | Commit | Command | Browser UI Opened | Child Worker/Model Processes Excluded | Steady RSS After Warmup | Peak RSS | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| StrokeGPT-ReVibed core idle | unavailable | unavailable | unavailable | unavailable | unavailable | unavailable | No sibling checkout or runnable legacy app was available under `C:\Users\welli\Documents` during Phase 1 scaffolding. This baseline remains required before rewrite memory claims are accepted. |
| MagicHandy Go core idle | pending Phase 1 working tree | `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o $env:TEMP\magichandy-phase1.exe ./cmd/magichandy`, then run built binary with `-addr 127.0.0.1:49718` | No, `Invoke-WebRequest` loaded `/` once | Yes | 8.96 MB (9,392,128 bytes) across 3 samples | Not measured separately | `/healthz` returned `ok`; `/` returned HTTP 200. |

## Procedure

For Windows local measurements:

```powershell
$env:CGO_ENABLED = "0"
go build -o $env:TEMP\magichandy.exe ./cmd/magichandy
$proc = Start-Process -FilePath $env:TEMP\magichandy.exe -ArgumentList "-addr", "127.0.0.1:49718" -PassThru -WindowStyle Hidden
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
1..3 | ForEach-Object {
  Get-Process -Id $proc.Id | Select-Object Id, ProcessName, WorkingSet64
  Start-Sleep -Seconds 1
}
Stop-Process -Id $proc.Id
```
